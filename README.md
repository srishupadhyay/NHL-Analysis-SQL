## Overview
This project analyzes various aspects of the NFL, such as player performance, team statistics, game outcomes, and season trends. I have used MS SQL Server to extract meaningful information from a relational database.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for the analysis is `nfl.db` file, which is available in the repository under 'Data'.

## Tools

- SQLite

## Data
